**Phobos** is a WIP project providing a set of new features and fixes for Yuri's Revenge based on [modified YRpp](https://github.com/Metadorius/YRpp) and [Syringe](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Syringe) to allow injecting code. It's meant to accompany [Ares](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Ares) rather than replace it, thus it won't introduce incompatibilities.

**Current features**
============

- **Full-color RGB PCX graphics support**
- **3 new warheads**
  - `[Warhead]➡TransactMoney= (integer - credits)`
    This many credits are added to warhead owner's credits when the warhead detonates. Use a negative number to subtract credits. Defaults to `0`
  - `[Warhead]➡SpySat= (boolean)`
    Reveals the map to the warhead owner when the warhead detonates. Defaults to `no`
  - `[Warhead]➡BigGap= (boolean)`
    Reshrouds the map for all opponents when the warhead detonates. Defaults to `no`
- **Save/load support**
- Ability to specify custom `gamemd.exe` icon via `-icon` command line argument followed by absolute or relative path to an `*.ico` file (f. ex. `gamemd.exe -icon Resources/clienticon.ico`)
- Disable black dot spawn position markers on map preview
- SHP debris now has their hardcoded shadows controlled by `Shadow` flag (defaults to `no`)


Building
--------

Windows:

0. Install Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" workload, "C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017 (v141) tools" individual component and clone this repo recursively.
1. Open the project file in VS and compile the project.

Upon build completion place the resulting `Phobos.dll` in your YR directory and launch Syringe targeting your YR executable (usually `gamemd.exe`).
